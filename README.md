# PrimeFactors: Practice writing functions with debugging and unit testing
Prime factors are the combination of the smallest prime numbers that, when
multiplied together, will produce the original number. Consider the following
example:
• Prime factors of 4 are: 2 x 2
• Prime factors of 7 are: 7
• Prime factors of 30 are: 5 x 3 x 2
• Prime factors of 40 are: 5 x 2 x 2 x 2
• Prime factors of 50 are: 5 x 5 x 2
when passed an int variable as a parameter, returns a string showing its prime factors;
a unit tests project; and a console application to use it. To keep it simple, you can
assume that the largest number entered will be 1000.
